# OpenSpace Project
Our first group project for the AI & Data Science Bootcamp at [BeCode](https://becode.org/). 


## Description

OpenSpace Organizer is a Python project designed to randomly assign colleagues to seats in an open-space office. The goal is to encourage team members to interact with different colleagues each day by shuffling seat assignments. The project uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and reads the list of colleagues from a CSV file.
